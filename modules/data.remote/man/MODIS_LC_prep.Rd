\description{
Prepare MODIS land cover data for the SDA workflow.
}
\details{
This function enables the feature of grabbing pre-extracted MODIS LC CSV files such that any site that 
has records will be skipped (See Line 33). In more detail, we will be loading the previous `LC.csv` file, which
contains previous extracted land cover records and trying to match that with current requests (location, time).
Any requests that fail the match will be regarded as new extractions and combine with the previous `LC.csv` file.
